# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
This analysis will summarize how the ride-sharing data differ by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. Using these data, visualizations will be developed to help PyBer improve access to its ride-sharing services and determine its affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

The ride-sharing data is from January to early May of 2019 and includes the following:
- Total rides
- Total drivers
- Total fares
- Average fare per ride and driver
- Total fare by city type

## Results: 

The summary table below provides a quick visual of how each city type is broken down by total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and total fares.

General Observations:
- As the total number of rides and drivers increases, the average fare per ride and average fare per drive decrease, which creates an inverse relationship amongst these data.
- While there are significantly more drivers in urban cities, this results in each driver earning less. The supply of drivers is higher than the demand for rides in urban cities.
- Suburban and rural cities have fewer drivers than the number of rides, so these drivers end up earning more than an urban city driver. 
- PyBer has the strongest presence in urban cities with the highest total rides, drivers, and fares as compared to suburban and rural cities.
- PyBer is more expensive to use in less densely populated and more spread out environments, like suburban and rural cities. However, drivers are earning more in rural cities than in any other city type. 

The line chart below displays the total fares by city type by month.

General Observations:
- Urban, suburban, and rural cities saw the highest total fares in late February. 
- In early January, urban and suburban cities experienced the lowest total fares. Rural cities had its lowest total fares in mid-February, just before it peaked. 

## Summary
- PyBer has been the most popular in urban cities, so keeping up that momentum with more marketing could help to attract more users and drivers. The company should invest more in increasing demand in suburban and rural cities. This could be through marketing on social media and incentives, like higher discounts for new users in these cities compared to urban city residents. 
- Drivers in urban cities make the least compared to those in the other city types, so if it is possible, PyBer can incentivize those drivers to continue working for them and attracting new drivers by subsidizing their earnings through some sort of base rate on top of the fare per ride. 
- Another recommendation is to charge riders more per mile in urban cities to account for wear and tear to the driversâ€™ cars and the longer wait times when there may be gridlock traffic. Along the same lines, PyBer could start charging peak travel time premiums (e.g. morning and evening commute times, weekends, special events in the area).
